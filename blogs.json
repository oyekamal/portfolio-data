        "introduction": "Performance optimization is crucial for Django applications in production. In this comprehensive guide, I'll share 10 proven techniques that helped me reduce API response times by 40% and handle thousands of concurrent users. These strategies are based on real production experience at scale.",
        "sections": [
          {
            "heading": "1. Database Query Optimization",
            "content": "The most common performance bottleneck in Django applications is inefficient database queries. Use select_related() for foreign key relationships and prefetch_related() for many-to-many relationships to reduce query count. Always check the number of queries with Django Debug Toolbar in development."

          {
            "heading": "2. Implement Redis Caching",
            "content": "Redis caching can dramatically improve response times. Cache frequently accessed data like user sessions, API responses, and database query results. Use Django's cache framework with Redis backend for optimal performance. Set appropriate cache timeouts based on data volatility."
