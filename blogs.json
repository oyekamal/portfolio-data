            "heading": "2. Implement Redis Caching",
            "content": "Redis caching can dramatically improve response times. Cache frequently accessed data like user sessions, API responses, and database query results. Use Django's cache framework with Redis backend for optimal performance. Set appropriate cache timeouts based on data volatility."

            "heading": "7. Optimize Static Files Delivery",
            "content": "Use Django's collectstatic and serve static files through a CDN or web server like Nginx. Enable compression and browser caching. Consider using Django Compressor or Whitenoise for better static file handling."
